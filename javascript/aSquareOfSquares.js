// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

// Task
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

// Examples
// is_square (-1) # => false
// is_square   0 # => true
// is_square   3 # => false
// is_square   4 # => true
// is_square  25 # => true
// is_square  26 # => false


function isSquare(n) {
  return n % Math.sqrt(n) === 0 || n === 0;
}

console.log(isSquare(-1)); // => false
console.log(isSquare(0)); // => true
console.log(isSquare(3)); // => false
console.log(isSquare(4)); // => true
console.log(isSquare(25)); // => true
console.log(isSquare(26)); // => false
