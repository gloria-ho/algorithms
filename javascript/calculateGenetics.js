// Calculate genetics
// Given the following object of parents and their genetic probabilities, write a function that takes two parents and two traits, and calculates the percent chance that a child with those parents will have that trait, based on the parents' genes

// (note: for this question we are ignoring the dominant and recessive mechanisms of true gene expression)

// Ex: (['Amanda', 'Gerald'], ['blueEyes', 'brownHair']) -> .096% chance that their child will have both blue eyes and brown hair.
